I came up with the idea of a bird building a nest, and found this video that is suitable for showing a concept of a bird building a nest.

Below is a link to the demo of the create application.

This app shows a simulation of a simple bird that was created using meshes in godot game engine, the app is very simple but has complicated steering behaviours to control the bird, the goal of the game is that bird is collecting branches and bringing them to the nest, until 100 branches are collected.
